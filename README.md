**UIFusion** is a Swift project demonstrating how to bridge the lifecycle and navigation flow between **SwiftUI** and **UIKit**. It provides clear examples and reusable techniques to integrate both UI frameworks in a clean and maintainable way.

## 🚀 Features

- Understand the SwiftUI view lifecycle in detail
- Navigate from SwiftUI to UIKit views
- Embed UIKit view controllers within SwiftUI
- Demonstrate best practices for hybrid app development

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Swift 5+
- SwiftUI
- UIKit
- Xcode
